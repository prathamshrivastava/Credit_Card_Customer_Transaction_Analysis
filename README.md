💳 Credit Card Customer & Transaction Analytics (Data Analyst Portfolio Project)

📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world credit card issuing company's data environment and demonstrates the full workflow of a data analyst working with messy financial data.
The dataset contains 100,000+ synthetic records representing customers, credit cards, transactions, and payments. The data is intentionally dirty and uncleaned to mimic real-world datasets that analysts encounter in financial institutions.

The goal of this project is to showcase skills in:
1. Data Cleaning
2. SQL Data Analysis
3. Business Intelligence & Visualization
4. Fraud & Risk Analysis
5. Customer Behavior Analytics

This project follows a realistic end-to-end analytics pipeline, from raw messy data to meaningful business insights.

Business Scenario
A financial services company that issues credit cards wants to analyze its portfolio to better understand:
1. Customer demographics
2. Credit card usage patterns
3. Transaction behavior
4. Payment performance
5. Fraud risk

Revenue streams
The company’s raw data contains numerous data quality issues due to system migrations, inconsistent data entry, and multiple data sources.
As a Data Analyst, the task is to:
1. Clean and prepare the data
2. Ensure data integrity across tables
3. Analyze key financial and customer metrics
4. Build dashboards and insights for stakeholders

4️. Payments Table
Billing cycle and payment information.
Key fields include:
1. payment_id
2. card_id
3. billing_cycle_start
4. billing_cycle_end
5. statement_balance
6. minimum_payment_due
7. payment_amount
8. payment_date
9. payment_method
10. payment_status

12. days_past_due

Intentional Data Quality Issues
The dataset intentionally includes real-world messy data problems to practice data cleaning.
Examples include:
1. Missing Values
2. Missing income
3. Empty gender fields
4. Missing payment dates
5. Duplicates
6. Duplicate customer, card, and transaction records.
7. Inconsistent Categories

Analytical Questions
